 timur.1.a: "The Horde will persevere!"
 timur.2.t: "A New Capital"
 timur.2.d: "The clans are divided, fractured between the Barlas and Suldus of the north, and the Qara'unas in the south.

Our own beys look not to the enemy, but to their old feuds and selfish greed. We will have to face this alone. \n\nWe have asked a rising military leader of the Barlas clan in the North of our realm to help us fight off the invaders. Although physically handicapped, this son of some minor noble has proven to be an excellent general. Let us hope this Timur can can be our saving grace."

The Empire of the Great Genghis will be restored, and all peoples will bow before the Empire of Timur!"

She is the daughter of Qazan, the last Khan of the united Chagatai Khanate.

Once whole, the Khanate has split into two halves, dividing the more settled, Turkic west from the deeply tribal Mongolian east.\n\nIn the disunity that has followed, our western horde has found itself divided into north and south, between the Barlas and Suldus of the north and the Qara'unas of the south. The Khans have long become puppets, and the divided clans now look to us, leaders of the Qara'unas for leadership.

The Horde however has fallen into anarchy, as claimaints from all clans seek to install puppet Khan's and claim dominance over what little remains.\n\nIn this time of great chaos, another opportunity has revealed itself. Tokhtamysh, of the Jochi has come to our court, seeking our support to overthrow his relatives and unite the broken Wings of the Golden Horde. His ambition seems matched by character, and his success seems likely. What is the Gurkani's decision?"

 timur.46.a: "Auspicious times..."
 timur.47.t: "Tokhtamysh flees to our court"
 timur.47.d: "In a shocking turn of events, the Khan of the Blue Horde has crushed Tokhtamysh's forces, leaving the supporters that remain fleeing to our court. Tokhtamysh kneels before Timur, humiliated yet determined. He seeks our continued support, seeking to wait for an opportunity to strike the Blue Horde."
 timur.47.a: "He may yet serve us"
 timur.47.b: "Enough of this, send him off to his uncle"
 timur.48.t: "Ascendance of Tokhtamysh"
 timur.48.d: "Our support has paid off, for we have gained the support of Tokhtamysh, now Khan of the Blue Horde. The Eastern Wing is under his banner, and he promises the reunification of the Golden Horde in time, all with tribute and rewards for the Gurkani."

 timur.49.t: "The Golden Horde"
 timur.49.d: "Long has Tokhtamysh dreamed of a greater power, a unified Khanate of Golden Wings to restore the glory of Horde. Now, the time is here. Our existence is secured, our forces mustered, our clans unified and our ruler supreme. Shall we strike at Sarai, and restore the Horde?"
 timur.49.a: "For the Horde!"
 timur.49.a: "It is not yet time..."
 timur.50.t: "Golden Wings"
 timur.50.d: "The day has come, for Tokhtamysh has rallied the clans and invaded the White Horde to restore the Khanate. The Golden Horde may yet be restored, and our tribute from the north endowed with new gains."

 timur.51.t: "Tokhtamysh Defeated"
 timur.51.d: "The Blue Horde has slain Tokhtamysh, ending the threat to their Khanate and destroying his supporters. Our efforts have been for naught."
 timur.51.a: "Humiliating...."
 timur.52.t: "Tokhtamysh in Chains"
 timur.52.d: "The threat is over, for Timur has sent us Tokhtamysh in chains. Our Khanate is secure, and Timur for now seems to have ignored us once more."
 timur.52.a: "Peace at last?"
 timur.53.t: "Submission of the Khan"
 timur.53.d: "Our campaign in the east has seen us capture the heart of the Blue Horde, their seat in Sighnaq. With this victory we now have a chance to transcend the Wings of the Khanate, and reunite the Golden Horde under one Khan."

In a suprising move however, he has offered terms. If we surrender all rightful Chagatai territory, peace will reign in the east. Shall we accept his mercy?"
 timur.56.a: "We will yield his claims"
 timur.56.b: "We fight until our last breath!"
 timur.62.t: "Hindustan Burns"
 timur.62.d: "Our war with the demon of the west has seen its inevitable conclusion, for Timur has swept across our lands on his path of destruction.

 timur.62.a: "We will pay tribute"
 timur.62.b: "We fight until our last breath!"
 timur.63.t: "Syria Burns"
 timur.63.d: "Our war with the demon of the east has seen its inevitable conclusion, for Timur has swept across our lands on his path of destruction. Timur's forces have swept through Syria, sacking the north and leaving our authority threadbare at best. Our advisors suggest that we abandon the north, offer tribute, and reclaim our lands when Timur eventually returns home. Shall we retreat?"
 timur.63.a: "We abandon Northern Syria"
 timur.63.b: "These are our lands!"
