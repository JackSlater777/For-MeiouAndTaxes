 POP_Urban_Goods_Chosen.001.d: "A budding urban industry has arisen in §G$PROVINCENAME$§!.  Soon, the artisans of the city will begin to master and specialise in the production of a specific type of urban good: §GLinen§!, §OMetalworks§!, or §BCloth§!.  If the province acquires a Centre of Production, the artisans will further hone their expertise and once skilled enough, will eventually be allowed to choose a luxury good.\n\n---§GLinen§! can upgrade to Leather, Paper, or in the Middle East and North Africa, Carpets.\n\n---Metalwork can upgrade to Jewellery, Steel, and in East Asia, Chinaware, or everywhere else, Glassware.\n\n---Cloth can upgrade to Luxury Cloth or Silk.\n\n---If the province has at least Rank 2 Harbour Infrastructure, it can upgrade to Naval Supplies with either Linen, Metalworks, or Cloth."
 POP_Urban_Goods_Chosen.003.d: "A long tradition of metalworking has come to fruition in §G$PROVINCENAME$§!.  The artisans of the city have honed their skills for generations, mastering their craft in rare and specialised ways.  Many craftsmen in the city have now moved on to more sophisticated goods, the nature of which you may influence if you so choose.  The first choices are Steel and Jewellery.  If the city has at least a level 2 Harbour, you may choose Naval Supplies.  If the city is in East Asia, you may also choose Chinaware. If it is not, you may finally choose Glassware.\n\nIf you manage to manufacture enough of a given luxury good per capita, your country will receive special bonuses because the good is prevalent and cheap to your citizens.  The last option in the menu will give you more information about what each luxury good offers."
 POP_Urban_Goods_Chosen.003.z: "§TGlassware§! is what I choose.  This will also add 100 urban wealth to the province."
